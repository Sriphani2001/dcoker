# dcokerThe big picture (what we’re making)
Think of your app like a small cinema + music lounge on the internet:

a front door (login page),

a lobby (dashboard with buttons: Music, Videos, Playlists, Settings),

rooms where people watch videos and listen to music,

a back office that stores accounts, playlists, and where the actual video/audio files live.

The tools (simple choices that play nicely together)
Website builder: Next.js (a React-based website tool)

Accounts + database: Supabase (keeps users and playlists safe)

Video streaming: Mux or Cloudflare Stream (they make your videos play smoothly everywhere)

Hosting (where it lives online): Vercel (website) + Render/Railway (tiny Python helper)

Your computer: Windows + VS Code to edit files

Step-by-step (plain English)
Create the “venue” online

Open a Supabase account (this is your secure database + login system).

Open a Mux/Cloudflare Stream account (this stores/serves video nicely).

You’ll get a few secret keys—think of them as master keys to the building. Save them; don’t share.

Start the website on your computer

In VS Code, make a new Next.js project.

This gives you a basic website you can open at http://localhost:3000 (only you can see it for now).

Add a front door (login)

Connect your website to Supabase so visitors can sign up / log in.

After login, they’ll land on your dashboard.

Build the lobby (dashboard)

Make a simple page with big buttons: Music, Videos, Playlists, Settings.

Clicking each button goes to its room.

Tell the site what a “playlist” and a “media item” are

In Supabase, create tables for:

Media (each song or video)

Playlists (named collections)

Playlist items (which media is in which playlist)

This is just organizing shelves so you can find things later.

Teach it to play video and music

Video: use the link from Mux/Cloudflare (they provide a special streaming URL).

Music: use a normal audio URL.

Put a simple player on each page with Play/Pause/Next.

Let users save their stuff

Add buttons: Create Playlist, Add to Playlist, Remove.

Save that info to Supabase so when they come back, it’s still there.

Remember where they stopped

While a video or song plays, regularly save the current time (e.g., “2 minutes 14 seconds in”) to the database.

Next time they open it, start from there. It feels “smart.”

Try it all locally

On your computer, click through: login → dashboard → open videos → play → create playlist → add items.

If that works, you’re ready to go live.

Put the site on the internet (deploy)

Create a free Vercel account and connect it to your project.

Add your Supabase and Mux keys in Vercel (so the live site can talk to them).

Click Deploy. You’ll get a real web link you can share.

(Optional) Tiny helper service

A small Python service can keep your secret video keys extra safe and handle tasks like “add this new video to Mux.”

Host that on Render/Railway. Your website calls it quietly in the background.

Watch it, maintain it

If something breaks, Vercel and Supabase show logs (error messages).

Add more features later (likes, comments, sharing) without changing the basics.

What you’ll actually see while building
A simple Welcome to Meurs — please log in page.

After login, a Dashboard with big cards.

Videos page showing your playlists; click one → a clean video player + a list on the side.

Music page with an audio player and a list of songs.

Buttons to Create Playlist and Add/Remove items.

When you refresh, your stuff stays (because it’s in the database).
